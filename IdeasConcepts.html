<body><h1>Ideas and concepts</h1>

<p>The following table contains ideas and concepts I am interested in.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact me, if you are interested in any of these topics. Especially, I will be glad for any hints on books, web sites etc. that have tackled any of these ideas already.</p>

<td>portal_ideas_concepts</td>
<td>Portal for Ideas and Concepts</td>
<td>There should be a portal dedicated for presentation and discussion of ideas. This portal would be rather broad and rather shallow. Broad means, ideas could range from the most basic home improvement to social reform. Shallow means, the portal would not support more than presentation and discussion of ideas. Specifically, it would offer no support for realizing ideas. Rather, discussions could lead to a decision to start realizing the idea outside of the portal. If a discussion results in the insight that research is needed, interested people would move to a research portal. If the idea turns out to be a business idea, someone would start a project on a crowd funding portal etc.</td>

<td>theory_possible_ethics</td>
<td>Theory of Possible Ethics</td>
<td>Let A be a set of actions. Let V (as in values) be an ordered set. Then an ethic is defined as a mapping from A into V. In the most simple case, V may contain only 2 values, e.g., good and bad. There could also be 3 values like bad, indifferent, good. Has this very abstract treatment of ethics already been considered? Could it make understanding, evaluation and comparison of different ethics easier?</td>

<td>theory_small_societies</td>
<td>Theory of Small Societies</td>
<td>It is impossible to analyze a real society of, say, 10 million persons, by observing all individual members and their relationships. This is possible, however, for a society with very few members. For instance, one can argue, that there are essentially 2 types of societies with 2 members: Either one dominates (rules over) the other, or both live as equal partners. But even with 3 members the situation is not that trivial anymore. Thus, I think it is worthwhile to develop a theory of small societies with 3, 4, 5 members. This may shed some light on real, i.e. large societies.</td>

<td>simple_local_storage</td>
<td>Hardware for Simple Local Storage</td>
<td>When I first started to use a computer privately, I was very careless regarding backups. Today, I have more discipline and make backups at least every few days on USB sticks. Of course, nowadays, one can use some cloud service for backup. Still, I am rather fond of local storage. How could this be made real simple? The storage media could be somewhat enhanced USB sticks. It would be nice, e.g., to have a little display that shows the date of the backup. These media could be put into some device that is connected to the computer and the device would move one storage item further per day for, say, 6 days, then restart.</td>

<td>isolated_computing_devices</td>
<td>Isolated Computing Devices</td>
<td>Today it is common to connect a computing device to a network. This is useful for many use cases, for some, it is necessary. But not for all. One could imagine an isolated device used for private records, reflections, ideas. The user would make all necessary input directly and not need network connection.</td>

<tr>
<td>search_export_by_browser</td>
<td>Browser Based Export of Search Results</td>
<td>Many web sites have a search capability. Sometimes the user is offered to export the search result for local storage and further processing, but not always.  It would be nice to have a kind of browser add-on that allows export of any search result.</td>

<td>multiway_shipping_boxes</td>
<td>Multiway Shipping Boxes</td>
<td>Many shipping boxes can be reused for another shipment, transport or storage. Indeed, many people do this on their private initiative. However, with many packages ordered online, most boxes will end up in trash after one use, because an average private person just has no use for that many shipping boxes. Therefore, it could be useful to have shipping boxes that can circulate multiple times. These could be collected by a parcel service on delivery.</td>

<td>multiway_jars</td>
<td>Multiway Jars</td>
<td>
Glas jars are a kind of container that fit many purposes and are very durable. Therefore, I think, it is a pity that so many glas jars are disposed after a single use. Of course, quite a number are recycled but this comes at a cost of a lot of energy.
So I wonder whether there could not be a system of using jars multiple times. This could be implemented in a similar way as the multi-use of glass bottles for mineral water in Germany.

<td>private_cabins_public_transport</td>
<td>Private Cabins in Public Transport</td>
<td>
A principal disadvantage of public transport is the presence of many persons in little space. Few people like this, many can accept this,
some can stand it with effort only. This is a principal disadvantage, as it is precisely the principle of public transport that it is used
by many people simultaneously. This disadvantage could be reduced, though, by introduction of private cabins. One or two seats would
be separated by walls or screens. With appropriate material and construction these could be rather light and still provide privacy.
Passengers preferring this privacy could access these cabins after paying a small supplement.
